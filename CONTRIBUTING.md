# Contributing to Pancake ü•û

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pancake! Your input and contributions help us make this library better for everyone. This document outlines the process and guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Fork the repository**: Visit [Pancake on GitHub](https://github.com/guibranco/pancake) and click the `Fork` button.
2. **Clone your fork**: Use the following command to clone the repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pancake.git
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies via Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
4. **Create a branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <feature-or-bugfix-name>
   ```

## Development Guidelines üõ†Ô∏è

### Code Style ‚úçÔ∏è

- Follow the [PHP-FIG PSRs](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) (e.g., PSR-1, PSR-12).
- Ensure your code is clean and readable.
- Use meaningful variable and method names.

### Compatibility üíª

- Pancake targets **PHP 8+** but aims to maintain compatibility with lower PHP versions when feasible. Test your changes across multiple PHP versions if possible.

### Testing üß™

- We use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for unit testing. Add tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- Ensure that the library maintains at least **80% code coverage**.
- The project uses [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/) to mock HTTP requests in integration tests

#### Setting up WireMock

This avoids making real HTTP requests to external services during testing, which can lead to rate limiting and flaky tests.
WireMock is configured to run in a Docker container. To start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start both the MySQL database and WireMock services. WireMock will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Verifying WireMock is Running

You can check if WireMock is running by executing:

```bash
php tests/check-wiremock.php
```

This script will check if WireMock is available and ready to accept requests.

#### Running Tests with WireMock

Once WireMock is running, you can run the tests:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The integration tests for the `Request` class will use WireMock instead of making real HTTP requests to external services.

#### Adding New WireMock Stubs

If you need to add new HTTP request patterns for testing, you can add new stub mappings in the `tests/wiremock/mappings` directory. Each mapping is a JSON file that defines a request pattern and its corresponding response.

For example, to add a new endpoint that returns a specific JSON response:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "/my-endpoint"
  },
  "response": {
    "status": 200,
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "jsonBody": {
      "message": "Hello, World!"
    }
  }
}
```

For more information on WireMock stub mappings, see the [WireMock documentation](https://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/).

### Running Code Sniffer

```bash
vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=PSR12 src/
```

### Documentation üìñ

- Update documentation in the `docs/` directory and any relevant markdown files if your changes affect functionality.
- Documentation is published via GitHub Pages, so ensure all updates are clear and concise.

### Composer Support üéµ

- The library is distributed via Composer. Ensure that `composer.json` reflects accurate metadata and dependencies for your changes.

## Submitting Your Contribution üì®

1. **Commit your changes**: Follow good commit message practices. Example:
   ```
   [FEATURE] Add new Pancake flipping method
   ```
2. **Push your branch**: Push your branch to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin <feature-or-bugfix-name>
   ```
3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original [Pancake repository](https://github.com/guibranco/pancake) and open a pull request.

### Pull Request Checklist ‚úÖ

- [x] Code follows the PSRs and project standards.
- [x] All tests pass with PHPUnit.
- [x] Code coverage is at least 80%.
