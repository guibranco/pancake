## About

The `MemoryCache` class provides a mechanism for caching data in shared memory using PHP's `shmop` functions. This is useful for performance optimization by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from slower storage mediums.

## Requirements

This requires `shmop` to be active with your PHP settings.

## Available methods

### openMemory

Opens a shared memory block and returns the memory identifier.

### writeJsonInMemory

Writes JSON-encoded data to the shared memory.

### readJsonInMemory

Reads data from the shared memory and decodes it from JSON.

## Usage

```php
$cache = new MemoryCache();
$data = ['key' => 'value'];
$cache->writeJsonInMemory($data);
$retrievedData = $cache->readJsonInMemory();
```

## Testing

Unit tests for the `MemoryCache` class are available in the `tests/MemoryCacheTest.php` file.
